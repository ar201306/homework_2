# homework_2
  Created my own personal webpage from scratch by using only bootstrap every content in webpage was from bootstrap and made all my html pages connect to one another by setting up link refs to each one of my pages on the dropdown menus. Dropdown was from bootstrap under link navs and dropdown menu, needed to nest the dropdown menu in nav links to be able to have it inside external content in nav bar. Made slide show in my portfolio of my favorite hero and my contact page is setup directly from bootstrap under input group. Contact page was from input forms and inputed my link to my linkedin account.
